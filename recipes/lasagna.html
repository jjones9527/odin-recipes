        <h3>This lasagna is the perfect make-ahead dinner — recipe creator ETHELMERTZ suggests making it a full day in advance and refrigerating it overnight to allow the flavors to intensify. Reviewers recommend adding extra sauce to the lasagna to keep it from being dry. "I have found my staple lasagna recipe! I put it together the night before, baked it covered for 1 hour and uncovered for 20 minutes. My husband said it was just as good as the lasagna his Italian stepfather makes, and he's been cooking for more than 50 years," says home cook Joanna Stevens.</h3>
