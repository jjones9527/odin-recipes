        <h3>This lasagna is the perfect make-ahead dinner — recipe creator ETHELMERTZ suggests making it a full day in advance and refrigerating it overnight to allow the flavors to intensify. Reviewers recommend adding extra sauce to the lasagna to keep it from being dry. "I have found my staple lasagna recipe! I put it together the night before, baked it covered for 1 hour and uncovered for 20 minutes. My husband said it was just as good as the lasagna his Italian stepfather makes, and he's been cooking for more than 50 years," says home cook Joanna Stevens.</h3>

        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes; drain fat. Mix in diced tomatoes, tomato paste, brown sugar, basil, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and oregano. Simmer meat sauce, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain. Lay noodles flat on towels; blot dry.</li>
            <li>Mix together ricotta, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, eggs, parsley, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Layer 1/3 of the noodles in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 1/2 of the ricotta mixture, 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and 1/3 of the meat sauce. Repeat. Top with remaining noodles and meat sauce. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
